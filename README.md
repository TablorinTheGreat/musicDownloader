# musicDownloader
a python script for downloading your music history from youtube using pytube.
(you can run the script a few times and it won't download the same songs twice)

## how to use
put your google account username and password in the script and choose a name for the songs folder and run.

## bugs
for some unknown reason pytube fails to download all songs, the songs which failed to download are saved to a file.
